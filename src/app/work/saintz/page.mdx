## Overview

    I took over this project in an unfinished, quite desolate state after the previous developer had to unexpecteldy leave the project.

    After taking inventory, I completely refactored the backend, fixed mulitple security vulnerabilites, polished the frontend and brought the project to a smooth launch.

    Now I am maintaining the project and conitinuoulsy develpoping new features for the client.
