## Overview

Avolut powers the backend system of Chicorée Mode AG, one of Switzerland's largest fashion retailers. They have more than 600k active customers on their system and process transaction worth multiple millions per day.

This requires software that is reliable as well as flexible in order to account for the fast changing requirements of a dynamic business.

I help Avolut achieving those goals by putting a lot of effort in the inital design and architecture of newly implemented features in order to provide simple and esailiy maintanable code as well as preventing technical debt early on.

As an example, I refactored the notification system by using an optimized queuing setup as well as infrastructure autoscaling of email rendering as well as message processing workers, reducing the time required to notify all custmers from 6hrs to under 1.5 hrs.
