## Overview

Encointer is a platform that provides Proof-Of-Personhood technology on the Polkadot blockchain.

I was helping Encointer to build and enhance their core protocol for more than 2 years, scaling their core algorithms to linear asymptotic complexities that are viable to be executed on-chain.

As the delivered code needs to reliably run on a blockchain, I put a lot of effort in writing thorough unit- and integration tests in order to guarantee maximum robustness of the code.

Also I developed an on-chain democracy module from scratch and built several off-chain webapps like an indexer for Polkadot parachains or an accounting app for Encointer communities.
